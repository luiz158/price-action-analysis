I opened a bear position at 3 bar expecting a bear spike.

However, the market hesitated for some time. That made my position closed at bar 1.

Immediately after, the market did a craved bear spike.

If my position hadn't been closed, I would have exited with a full take-profit price.

Probably, that made my pshychology untidy.

I opened another sell position for following bear spike at bar 2 to follow the market as much as possible.

Again, the market never revisited to the take-profit price after opening my position.

Today something was wrong....
