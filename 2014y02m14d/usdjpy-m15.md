I was waiting the resumption of the bear trend early this day.
 The tight bear channel 5 was so impressive every trader was awaiting the bear trend resumption.

First, the market broke to the downside from the pullback 7 around bar 7. Because the two legged clear pullback 6 was adequate as a pullback of the very strong bear trend, as a natural consequence, first entry 8 was created, which I missed. As first entry usually transforms often, the first entry became trading range 8. The setup was also a moving average gap setup bar 7.

As a second entry, I finally opened a bear position two bar after the failed break bar 9. To be honest, I was a bit feeling urgency of missing the bear trend again.

Because of such a bear's common feeling, a swing after my entry bar was held below the high of the proceeding swing 9. Bears was flocking into the market.

Up to the this stage, the market couldn't break out the major bear trend line 4, eluding the atmosphere of the bear trend in this aspect too. Then, the expected break out happened from the trading range 8 at bar 1.

The bar 2 was very significant for the destiny of following mid-term trend of the market. I was expecting bear trend, however it turned out to be a two bar reversal bull setup bar. It was also breakout failure setup bar for bulls to happily jump into the market. It soared up after the bar by the way. If the bar 2 showed more strength of bear trend with like a small inside doji or a second bear trend bar, probably there would be a bear trend resumption. As discussed, really the bar 2 was the turning point.

Shortly after confirming bear's weakness, I closed my bear position with small loss with market order.
