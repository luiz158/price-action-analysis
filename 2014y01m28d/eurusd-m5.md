As a whole, today's EURUSD was bear-then-bull trend resumption day.

First, following a bear spike, there was a trading range 1, and a horizontal shrinking triangle inside it too. The trading range was rather prolonged and the bear spike after it looked like an exhaustion because of it.

Also, the tight bull channels 3 and 4 indicated the bulls was getting power increasingly. At later of the day, this ultimately was proven by some more bull attack after the really strong bull spike 11.

After the bear two-legged bear spike to around the bar 3, there was a large triangle created by trend line 5 and 6.

The triangle was terminated by bar 10 break out. And a doji after 3 bars was a break out pull back to touch the bottom part of trend line 5.

Then, a whatever US economic report was released to the public with much surprise at 15:30, which directly translated into the spike 11 in the market-wise.

After the spike, the market was quick to become stable with the trading range 2. Inside it, there was slight inclination to the bull side. This is signified by the three-bar micro triangle 9.

The bull breakout was imeanient to happen. And it was likely that the breakout would reach to the original major support price level of major bear trend before the day at least.

So, I set up a bull position above the triangle with stop loss of bottom of the trading range and take profit of the support.

As shown, the market gave me reward just after three bars.
