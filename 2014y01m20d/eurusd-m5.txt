The EURUSD market was weak bull trend day.

After the convergence of price by the triangle 1, the price broke out downside.

Bar 4 bear trend line supported the bear spike immediately. And the recover from the last bar of bear spike (bar 4) was also quick. This could mean this is fake bare breakout trapping eager bears.

After that, both the bulls and bears got aggressive and created expanding triangle 2.

The triangle ended with the touch of bear line of the triangle at bar 5, which was higher high compared to bar 4.

The bull was gaining momentum. Thus, the start of bull era.

So, I opened an early position with equidistance stop loss and take profit. But that was a bit late. I should have opened an bull position at the high of bar 6.

But the expected bull didn't appear. After an bull spike following bar 6, an rather strong bear tight trend channel appeard. There was more probality of trading range or even bear trend reversal. which actually occured after the difficulty of breaking out above the high of bar 7 at the trading range 8.
