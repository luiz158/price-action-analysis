The EURUSD market got active around bar 6. After a while, the price broke out down. And the market formed a typical trading range 3.

After the trading range the price started to converge while creating a triangle 1. As usual it meant the inevitable breakout from it.

It broke out downside again. There were the feeling of the major trend of beers amongst traders at this point. Naturally, they were expecting more downside breakouts.

Then, it happened at bar 5. There were three factors supporting the bear move. First was there were the third failed attempt to break bear trend bar 2 up. Second was a double top with bar 4 and 5. The third was the moving average reversal. Strong move was about to begin.

It spiked down strongly while being augmented with these factors. Believing in them, I aggressively opened a bear position below the low of the bar after 4, with stop loss of above the high of the first bar of the spike 7.

After my position was opened, I used trailing stop strategy, and closed by third bar after the first spike bar.

Also, I opened another position as a low 1 entry, which failed indicating the bears used all their energy to create two strong bear bar. They needed some rest.
