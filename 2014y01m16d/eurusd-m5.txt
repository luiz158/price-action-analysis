Today's EURUSD was a trading range day.

The resistance line 5 was formed by three bars indicating its strongness. And trend reversal is expected at the its third attempt, should it fail.

The trading range both 3 and 4 indicated there is no trend today in broader perspective too.


I was hoping bull trend reversal at 7 and 8. However they failed. Even more, the break out failrure at bar 8 was getting more bears because there was more gap between the high of bar 8 and the moving average than a gap beween the high of bar 7 and the moving average (bar 7 just touched the moving average before resuming the bear trend.

And then bear's attack continues. the larger wedge created by bar 5 and bar 6 was breached bars after bar 8. So I didn't open any position.
