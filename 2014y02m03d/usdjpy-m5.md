Today's USDJPY market formed a V-shaped large valley.

The micro trading range indicated uncertainty of the ruler of the market at that moment. The bears had been strong with the strong bear channel 1, however the bulls also gained power later.

First, there was the first pull back leg 2. It was rather weak, over-wrapping proceeding bars, missing to touch the moving average.

Then low 1 formed, but it failed to break pull back, resulting higher high.

Second, there was the second pull back leg 6. It was stronger than the previous leg 2. It penetrated the moving average. Then the trading range 4 above the moving average appeared.

The rhythm of the market was changing. Bears managed to break out below the trading range 4. However, it failed, quickly ending with the two-bar reversal setup. Eager bulls was getting into the market. And that pushed the market up. I was looking for a second entry of a buy position.

Before long, it happened at high 1 one bar pull back bar 5. I opened a buy position above the high of the bar with equivalent move from to the bar to the low of the failed bear break out
. Luckily, the market spiked up. Urgency hastened the development of price action.

My position was opened only for the 15 minutes or so.

After that climax, the market started to go down.
