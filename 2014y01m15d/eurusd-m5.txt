After trading range, EURUSD started to be discounted.

three pushes are done. Indicating a pullback. The three push downs were so strong that the second and third barely touched the moving average line.

bar 4 was strong bull reversal bar even if it breaked bellow previous lower low.

Around the moving average the price was stable and there were a trading range. Eventually it developed to a typical triangle.

At bar 5 the bears started to move the price down. the break out from the triangle was rather strong. After two consecutive strong bear bar, I opened a bear position at 1.36142 (sadly I got a significant slippege this time), expecting strong price down like it did from bar 1 to bar 3. Rather, the market moved down steadily. At bar 6 it started to form a pullback to the moving average.

Bar 9 was low 1 signal bar, which was breakout pullback second entry.

Bar 7 created double bottom with bar 6 starting a second pullback. That make bears worry about the trend reversal a bit. However the bears gained so much extremely strong momentum at bar 8 that they created 23.4 pips bear spike, closing my position with profit.
