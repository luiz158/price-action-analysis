First, the market moved crazily, sudden down (bear spike 1), up, and even bigger down (bear exhausition spike 2).

At this point, there ware 2 possibilities. One is that the market creates a typical spike and channel trend. Another is that it reverses up to the original price before the storm.

Usually, odds favor spike and channel trend. However, this spike move was so fierce because of both crazy bulls and bears. The two outcome could happen equally.

By this reason, that uncertainty created relatively tight trading range 3 with slight bear trend for some time. Both bulls and bears were ready to move the market at any time.

It was bulls that moved first. At bar 4, the bull succeeded to create a strong bull spike 4. The spike's size was like the previous storm.

It was obvious that the market's tempo changed to strong one. After all, the trading range 3 was just a temporary rest. Today's true nature of the merket was a berserker.

So, I opened a bull position with extremely strong bull trend strategy. However I failed immediately after by a rather strong pullback.

Then, I tried to enter the market with a second entry at 5. I however I closed my buy-stop order in the fear of buying at the top of the bull trend. After only a minute or so, the bull regained its power.

the bull spike bar 4

I thought the almost vertical rampent price up down moves = rhtym had happened at the breakout from the bear channel.

The bull spike bar 7 was so extreme that a fierce backfire is immenient. largely overshotting the major resistence line 8.

a almost-identical continuation doji bar after the strong two bar reversal from the spike 7.

I really quickly gained a moderate profit in less than 10 minutes.
