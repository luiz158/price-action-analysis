There was a hamble senior bull yet having not lost the mind of no mercy and bruntant grudge for bears in USDJPY spot foreign currency market today.

Frist, the bull was born with strong bull spike 11. Then the bull spent its youth in the cource of extended trading range 4.

In the middle of the trading range 4, there was rather gentle bear channel with one failed downside accelation and  one upthrust to the high of trading range 4. Both price action indicated gentle yet firm bull's insistence.

At the final stage of the trading range 4, there was second failed bear channel overshot 2. It failed exactly at the support line 10 based on the low of micro one-bar pullback after the bull spike 11. The hamble bull were aweaking from its hyposys.

To the extreme interpretation, we could say that the start of the following bull trend started at the bar 2. Continuting the interpretation, at bar 1, we could treat it as a higher high one bar pullback. The hamble bull were crawrling.

At this point I bought the bull yen.

After then, the presense of the bull were getting clear by the multiple over-layered bull trend lines with variable time-scales.

We could describe the bull as hamble because of triangle 9 and the resistance line 12. Nevertheless, the merket accumulating the inner energy. It wan't what I really wished, however it was acceptable anyway.

Reliefing enough for some time, the makret broke out to the uptrend.

Again the bull gently progressed its journey with  a trading range 6 above the high of preceeding trading range 4. Today was trending trading range day.

Today had been calm. But my position was killed by a sudden plunge at 5, which was caused by an unexpected outcome of an econimic event, which in turn I wasn't aware of.

The bear had some momentum, yet the bull had even more. The bull mercilessly excerted its power. The bull didn't let the bear touch the significant support line 10. The bull engulfed the bear completely.

I reopened a bull position. I expected a golden era of the bull. However, intead, bull just managed to form a higher trading range 7.

As I had already been betrayed once, my faith was quickly eroding. The deciding event happened at 8, where there was a micro double top overshotting the high of trading range 7.

I said farewell to the now near-death old bull with small profit shortly after.
