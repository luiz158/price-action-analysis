Today, I expected a bear trend after a strong bear spike.

But, that didn't happen. The market didn't show any remarkable trend.

First I missed a very good setup. It was a twenty moving average pull back setup. The market didn't touch the moving average for about 25 bars consecutively at 1. So bear trend was expected to the low of the bear trend 4 at least.

Also, I setup three setup for expecting resume of the bear trend, one of them was actually opened then turned out a little loss.

At 4, I was hoping for yet another bear spike bar.

At 3, I was hoping for another bear push down like 4 after breaking out 4 bars very tight trading range 5. But the market formed another similar pattern: very tight trading range and failed downside breakout and then trend reversal. At the completion of the reversal, it almost touched the moving average.
