EURUSD did considably plunged today.

Major bear trend channel 3

Inside it, there was long trading range 2

Then downside breakout to the trading range 2

Bear trend line 5 is created. This signified beggings of huge bear trend.

I expected more strength from the bar before bar 5. However, It hadn't such power. So I closed my position around the support line 6.

Then, a pull back is formed. To this point, there was bear trend line 4 steeper than past bear trend line 3. Bears was gaining power steadily.

Around end of pullback at the touch of bear trend line, I opened a bear position for the possible bear spike, quickly profitting at my usual take profit price.

Then market did go down more. So, I expected more accelaration of bear spike within a bar or two. I opened a bear position with this in mind because there was very favorable a doji bar at the bottom of big bear spike.

However it didn't. The market rested for about 25 minutes. For the rest, it never breakout above the support line 9. Bears was preparing to go down.

So, I opened bear position around the low of the pullback. I profited immediately inside the bar 8 again with my standard size of 10.0 pips.
