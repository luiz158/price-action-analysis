Although bear channel 3 was somewhat strong, I expected a major bull trend.

The inherent weakness of the channel was confirmed by the somewhat strong reversal bar 1.

Then at good shaped pullback, I opened a bull position. At the time, there was a economic news release in 15 minutes or so. That's because I closed my bull position inmaturely with a small profit.

Then the news release moved the market significantly. I opened a bull position to profit the remaining power of the spike at 4. However, it never did. As I became dissapointed, I closed the position with small profit again.
