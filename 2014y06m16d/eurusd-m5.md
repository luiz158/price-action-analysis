Today was a bull spike and channel day.

First, the maret was getting active while it was gaining a bull momentum with a bull spike 6, a pullback 7,  and trading range 3.

Then a bull day was initiated with a bull spike 4.

Afterwhile, there was trading range 2 as a following pull back.

In the bull major trend, I was looking for a bull setup. And one came.

It was the moving average test 1. it also formed a wide gap 5 at the same time. Also, the entry bar looked good.

I expected the merket to move to the high of the trading range 2 at the very least.

I didn't expected the breakout because there were already three failed breakouts in the trading range 2.

Using same width take-profit and stop-loss price target, I quickly profited close to the high of the trading range 2.
