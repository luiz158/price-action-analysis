In addition to USDJPY, I closed a bit immaturely for the fear of counter moves in EURUSD too.

I thought the duel is finished, however the market progressed against my expectation, indicating would-be profits.

I don't know my decision for closing my position was right or wrong. The market really moves randomly for nearly all of time. That makes me lose confidence of my trading style. Surely trading is hard.

In EURUSD, there was simple bear setup. As a first stage, the market moved down significantly with a spike 1. So, after the triangle consolidation of price (trading range 4), it's sensible to expect the resumption of bear trend for the reach of the low of doji reversal bar 2 at least.

From the triangle 4, bulls managed to slightly break out the moving average. But the bears soon became aggressive.

Creating two bar reversal bear setup and major trend line trend at 3.

After then, the market floated just below the moving average for somewhat long time. That nerved me for losing from the trading range. I couldn't withhold at bar 5.

I closed my position with small insignificant profit.

In spite of my concern, the market moved steady down. If I hadn't closed it, it would give me something good.

By the way, MetaTrader is updated to new major version 4.00.
