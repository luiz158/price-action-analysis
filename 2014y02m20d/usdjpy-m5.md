Strong trading channel 1

bear pullback

triangle 2

bull setup bar 2 and my bull entry to the market

rather string pullback 3. That feared me.

Then up trend with slower pace than the pullback 3. I exited the market fearing for a trading range or major trend reversal

However again, the market went upward in USDJPY too, meaning a would-be profit with a right trading range.

Additionaly in 15 minutes chart, the market formed a great setup for high 2 two reversal setup bar 5 also with the moving average touch at the same time.
