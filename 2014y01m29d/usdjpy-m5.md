First there was a dacent and typical bear trend channel 3.

Today's usdjpy had a really unusual tight bear channel 3. This was so impressive. It dropped the price with whopping 60.0 pips with no significant pull back.

The was an outside doji bar 2. It trapped bulls out. Slight indication of bear power.

I was expecting spike and trend channel pattern with same size as the height of trading range.

I won from a part of the spike.
