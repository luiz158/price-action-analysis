Micro bear trend line 5, pullack 4, low 1 setup, bear breakout bar 6, and micro pullback 7, gap 8, rather long duratino of not touching the moving average all indicated the bear pressure as a whole.

As a concequence, I opened a bear position intended for capturing a bear spike. This time, I was a bit impatient for the spike, so I closed my position with small loss, fearing pullback to the moving average or the high of the spike bar 6

Sadly, after I bailed out, the market moved down quite impressively.

After low 1 failed, the triangle 2 was converging price, aimming to the moving average.

Although, it isn't visible in this chart, the bar 3 really dropped instantly, so it was likely that further equivalent mesusured bargain is expected. So, I opened a bear position, then quickly profitting from following bear spike bar.

So it's kinkd of a micro spike and channel pattern.
