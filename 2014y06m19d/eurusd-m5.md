I profitted from a breakout from the triangle 7.

After the three push down pullback 8, I expected the market to resume the major bull trend.

That's because after the third push down 5, the market traded sideways.

Also the triangle was located above the moving average.

Confirming an expected bull breakout 6, I quickly closed my position when the market paused for a bit in the entry bar.
