Today, USDJPY did a steady great job of moving the market upward inside the major bull channel 1, which got bigger as time went.

The breach of trend channel line happened at two bar reversal. Then a trading range, then, downward breakout, then touch of the major bull trend bar 3.

Then the market had clear development.

As shown by trend lines and trend channel lines, the market had two-legged bull momentum.

After going above the high of trading range 4, I sensed the shift of rhythm ringing from the market even more. That is, embodiment of strong bull accelerated advance. Recently/Lately the USDJPY tended to go strongly for a long time both upward and downward.

However, I missed to be in the market the break out at the end of trading range 4.

So, as a second entry, I opened a bull position with stop loss of high of trading range 4, gathering of bulls at the micro triangle.

Sadly, I was wrong. The bulls failed after a while, forming the trading range 5. Before the formation, I had promptly exited from the market before the stop loss order was triggered.

Because the market had touched the major bull trend channel line, as a consequence, it moved down to touch the major trend line around at bar 6.

At the time of bar 6, the price dipped well below the moving average. So, bulls lost any chance of further price development blessed for them.

Thereby, the market went sideways after a while.
