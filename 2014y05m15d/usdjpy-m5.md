I profited from the early stage of an astonishingly strong bear major trend of USDJPY today.

First the market transitioned the character of the market structure from a silent state to a volatile state around 4 bar.

In the volatile time, there was a strong breakout, immediately followed by stronger bear trend reversal. Then, a bear breakout was formed.

At this time, there were two possibilities: another bull spike by the continued volatility, or successful bear. And the outcome was the later one. The market penetrated below the previous spike low of 6 at the bar 5. Also, after the bear breakout, there was price consolidation of trading range 1.

I was more or less expecting a further bear progress.

As usual in recent days, I was pessimistic so didn't expected not much from the bear trend.

In side the trading range 1, there was a micro bear channel with four consecutive bear bars. Also there was micro gar 3. This tipped to me that the market could drop for some amount.

So, with pessimism in mind, I opened a bear break out position at 7. Thanks to the previous volatility, although my sensation was such, I could setup a full slot position.

And my expectation come true. The market dropped with bear spike. That was rather more aggressive than my expectation.
So I worried a strong trend reversal like 6. So, I closed my position by market order.

After that, the bear market continued to exist recording an extremely steady and prolonged bear trend.
