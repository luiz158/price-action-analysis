trading range 1 under the moving average.

breakout 3. I opened a bear position for catching a very early major bear trend like previous bear major trend 5.

My strategy is with low probability, tight stop loss and large take profit.

two bar reversal after bar 3

then micro double top pullback

tight bear channel 2, which I exactly expected.

Firstly, the bull channel 4 looked a typical pullback channel.

But it prolonged and returned to the original price level.

So, I discarded my position with small loss.
