early bull channel with three consecutive higher highs 2

break out from significant resistance 1

one bar pullback

then I opened bull position with low probality, small loss, and large profit. I was planning to profit from the resumption of the major bull trend 5 early this day.

First, it moved to my favor with three dacent bull bars.

However, next large bear break bar.

And all three following bars didn't go above its previous high.

Then I gave up, closing my position with small loss.
