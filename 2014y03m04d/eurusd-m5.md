In summary, today I expected a bear move but the market failed to do so. And then I quickly switched to the bull mood but my bull position couldn't reach to the profit target by 0.2~0.3 pips and stop loss was triggered by 0.2~0.3 pips. Then market easily go to the sky, easily passing my unfilled bull position's profit.

I opened the first bear position because after touching the support line 6, I expected a doulbe top pattern. I was also thinking this way considering the previous strong prolonged tight bear channel 9.

I opened a bear position around bar 3. Then there was a trading range. Inside it, there was a small pullback. After the pullback, the market broke out down at bar 1. This was a crual part.

If the market could went down, my profit target is easily filled. So I carefully watched the price action more than usual.

After the strong bear breakout bar, there was a weak bull reversal bar. This was still acceptable. And next bar was a doji bar with long tail at top. This was very favoral for bears. So I was glad to see it.

However, the market opposed to the bear. It created strong bull reversal bar, closing my bear position with loss.

At this moment, the market captured sizable amount of trapped bears. So it's natural for it to go up at least around the support line 8. So I swiftly changed my mood from bear to bull and opened a bull position.

At first, the market moved as I expected. It moved upwards without any noteworthy halt to around the support 8. However, my take profit order wasn't triggered by 0.2~0.3 pips. This was really and really close.

The market departed from the support line after that. So it was now plausible the market to go down. I tightened my stop loss basing on the support/resitance line 5.

And then my position got out from the market by 0.2~0.3 pips. And then the market spiked to the top. I was really and really sad for the repeated unfortunates.
