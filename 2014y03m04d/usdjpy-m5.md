I was expecting a bull trend. Although it's arrived late, the bull surely suceeded to raise up.

First, as a bull trend formation, there was strong bull spike 9. It's top tails was rather big. This meant that bulls worried to some extent for its strongness. For this reason, slow and long bear trend channel 5 is created (In retrospct, it failed to breakout the high of bull spike bar 9 twice inside the trading range at early stage of it.

Finally, bulls maneged to escape from the prolonged bear channel by a bull spike bar 3. It was not so big but, strong enough to change the mood of the market.

After that, rather firm bear channel appeard as a pullback to the spike 3. At this moment, the market had two possibilities: failed bull breakout and larger trading range or bull reversal and bull trend continuation.

The latter came to the real with breakout bull bar from the firm bear channel, a doji with good position and shape and another bull bar. This move also created a small gap 4.

So, I opened a position betting for the bull.

However, the market wasn't quick to react, possibliy still being influenced by the bear channel 5. Following my bull position, the market formed a double top 2

Then the market flew horizontally.

The trendless time is ended by a hard-to-see two-legged infantory bull trend. The market was again getting into a trend from a trading range upto bar 8.
However the restored bull trend was interrupted by a longer term double top with 9 and 8, a part of a larger trading range.

However the market's mind wan't lost. It was still in bull mode. The pullback from 8 ended with creating 3-consecutive higher lows 1, 6 and 7.

As shown next many bars, the bull progressed streadily, blessing me with a full-slot take-profit order.
