I was expecting a bull trend. Although it's arrived late, the bull surely suceeded to raise up.

First, as a bull trend formation, there was strong bull spike 9. It's top tails was rather big. Bulls worried to some extent for its strongness. For this reason, slow bear trend channel 5 is created (In retrospct, it failed to breakout the high of bull spile bar 9 twice inside the trading range at early stage.

Finally, bulls maneged to escape from the prolonged bear channel by a bull spike bar 3. It was not so big but, strong enough to change the mood of the market.

After that, rather firm bear channel appeard as a pullback to the spike 3. At this moment, the market had two possibilities: failed bull breakout and larger trading range or bull reversal.

The latter came to the real with breakout bull bar from the firm bear channel, a doji with good position and shape and another bull bar. There was also a small gap 4.

So, I opened a position betting for the bull.

However, the market wasn't quick to react, possibliy still being influenced by the bear channel 5. Following my bull position, the market formed a double top 2

Then the market flew horizontally. The trendless time is ended by a hard-to-see two-legged bull trend, the market was again getting into a trend from trading range upto bar 8.
 The bull trend was interrupted by a longer term double top with 9 and 8 than double top 2, there by more larget trading range.

However the market's mind wan't lost however in bull mode. The pullback from 8 ended with creating 3-consecutive higher lows 1, 6 and 7.

As shown follwing many bars, the bull was progressed streadily, blessing me with a full take profit order.
