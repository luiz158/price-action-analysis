EURUSD didn't have any significant price movement. It was in the price consolidation phase.

After the completion of major bear trend channel 1, I expected my favorite trading pattern to appear, namely major trend reversal to the bull trend.

However, the wish is never fulfilled. As said at the front, the EURUSD didn't move price any noticeably, rather went sideways.

At bar 2, the bear channel reached the major support line 2. That support line is based on the original price level before the major spike-up 3 then the spike-down 2.

Also, the bar 2 looked like a exhaustion from the context.

Put all together, I thought the bear trend ended at the very least, and opmistically expecting a bull reversal.

First, I entered in the market with a high 2 entry 4. After seeing a strong two legged tight bull spike 6 and higher high 8.

However, the market went sideways this time with barbwire trading range pattern 5. Sadly, my position was shaken out from the market at bar 7.

Then a moment later, at the last half part of the trading range 5, the market was gradually expressing its desire to break out above. So I followed the suit. As a second entry, I opened a bull position with wider stop loss and take profit, and long time span in mind. My strategy was that I should take the fully-grown new high of the major bull spike 3, completing the recovery from the major bear trend 1.

After my second bull position was opened, the upside breakout from the trading range 5 failed quickly with accelerating spike down 6. This wan't good for my bull position. But, I accepted this because I was OK for one swing or two for a trade this time.

Although the bear reversal looked strong, it didn't break below the bottom of trading range 5. That means, it failed to form a bull-trap breakout failure pattern trapping bulls in. In other words, there was no bears.

Then, the market continued to go sideways for extended period of time, really. Eventually I became bored and got out from the market with small loss again.
