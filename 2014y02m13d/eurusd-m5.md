In hindsight, bulls barely regained its momentum in the EURUSD today.

In a situation where there was a shocking bull spike of 60.0 pips, it's natural to think of a resumption of bull trend. So, I was searching for any sign of it from the onset of my trading session.

In such a mindset, my eyes caught a clearly visible three bear pushes (leg 1, 2, and 3). I was primed to enter the market. After that, bulls steady went up. First, three bar tight bull channel. A short rest just below the trading range 9. Then another two bar tight bull channel, painlessly breaking out the significant resistance of the high of trading range 9.

Time had come. The market started to consolidate the price at trading range 7 just above the trading 9. At this point, it was clear the major pull back formed by 1, 2, 3 legs ended.

I was ready to enter the emerging bull market with buy stop order above the trading range 7. 

As for the profit target, I was basing on major measured move 6 and minor measured move 5 of about 10.0 pips. They coincided around the same price level, so it was likely that the market may reach there.

Although I was expecting a more gradual raise of price, unexpectedly there was another bull spike exhaustion bar. After completing reaching to the target of double measured up, the market turned down again remarkable speed.

Although it wasn't visible, the market went sideway after hours.
