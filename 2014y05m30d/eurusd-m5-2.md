After the two-legged accelerated bull spike 13, there was sudden strong bear spike 1.

As a scenario following a strong two-legged bull spike, this was rare. So, probably, many traders got surprised, and wondered the market got down-trend or not.

In the doubt in trader's mind, there was indication of bulls.

First, the spike bounced exactly off the bull trend channel line 4, which was very significant from the early market structure. And the spike also couldn't go below the low of the first bar of the first leg 3. Lastly, it also couldn't breach the resistance line 7.

Then, a bear pullback was formed. This one was important. Because the character of it would determine the future of the coming market trend.

It turned out that the pullback wasn't acutually a bear pullback, but a first bull leg.

The bull trend line 12 it delimited was strong a bit for a first bear pullback; four bull bars consecutively kept its lows higher than previous bar's low.

After the four bars, the pullback setup a possible low 1 setup around bar 12 as a test of the moving average. But the setup was never triggered.

Instead, the market spiked above the moving average. Then, again a low 1 setup was created.

Although it was second attempt to resume the bear trend, the bears barely succeeded to gather in the market. That was because the low of the bar after the bar 11 didn't break out in any meaningful way.

From the eyes of bulls, the spike 11 was the sign of bull trend resumption from the bull spike 13. Then, there was a bull pullback 14.
The pull back was strong to some extent. It moved exactly along side the bull trend line 12.

Considering the situation up to this moment, there was edges for bulls. Although the bear spike 1 was strong, the bulls wasn't paniced with it.

So, I was ready to join to the bulls. Then, there was a high 1 pullback setup 14.

The setup triggered my bull position.

Even in the favorable situration for bulls, I was careful for opening the bull position, so I set a take-profit and stop-loss order with same distance regardless it was a spike setup. I thought it was possible the market could suddenly reverse to the bear, creating a large triangle with the high of bar 13 and the low of bar 1. The reasoning came from the fact that once bears arrived the market, they abruptly plunged the price like a bear spike 1.

In the end, my position was closed quickly. And the market continued to raise. My fear wasn't appreciated, however I think it was worth to feel.
