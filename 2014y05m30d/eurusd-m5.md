Today I gained moderate profit.

First to regret, I could do better, but couldn't.

I missed a potential profit, because I didn't pay attention to the existence of hard-to-spot yet very-orderly-behaved bull channel 5 and bear channel 6.

After the economic news release at horizontal line 8, the market quickly and strongly changed to the bull mood.

At the end of the first bull spike 9, the bulls didn't exhausted. That means the bulls still didn't lose its all power. Then, a micro trading range 2 appeared, not a pullback. That means the bears were strong enough to resist the bull. Also, the trading was wide, signifying some volatility. The next possibilities was trading range or even trend reversal.

These two factors balances out each other. However at the end of the trading range 2, some time passed in the infancy bull market. That slightly tilted the odds to bulls.

At this moment, I was ready to enter to the market to buy the position.

Under such a condition, a high 1 setup bull bar 10 appeared with following characteristics:

1. It couldn't touch the moving average (bull)
2. It tried to test the bull trend channel line 4 (bull++)
3. The bar itself was a bear bar. (bear)
4. It penetrated for very short of time under the roughly defined resistance line 7.

The factor 2. was very important for position planning. However I didn't noticed it at the time of trading.

Although, the bull channel 5 and next bear channel 6 was somewhat hard to spot due to preceding market inactivity, both really were like textbook examples.

Such good patterns should never be overlooked, because the random market honors such coherent trader's mind very significantly.

At this recognition, we can re-interpret the market structure as follows:

1. a bull channel 5 (with more weight to the upper bound line)
2. a pullback (a bear channel 6)
3. a test of the trend channel line 4 of the bull channel 5.

So, actually there were more bulls than I analyzed.

Anyway, after spotting the setup a bit late, I opened a position and the market soared as guessed.

However I feared a bit. The market favored for me too much. I was feared that I was over-committing to a specific belief of bull strength.

So, my bull mood weakened.

All this was due to the absence of recognition of the existing inherent bull power as mentioned above.

So, I lowered my expectation from the opening position, making the width of my take profit order reduced equal to the width of the original stop loss order.

Then, my position was closed. Only after it, the market flew further to the sky 3, maybe triggered by the hiding bulls.
