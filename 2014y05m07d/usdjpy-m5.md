Today I opened a position according to the three-bar micro price action in the direction of the major bull trend. And I was lucky to exit near the high of the trend.

In the first part of the trading session, there was the first strong bull push-up 4 and the second strong bull push-up 5.

The market clearly exited from the quiet major trading range period.

The pullback 7 was so small that there is obvious urgency for the bulls. It didn't even touch the moving average.

After the possible completion of two-legged pullback 8, the market went up while not touching the moving average once again. However it failed at bar 6 of the double top.

Regarding the outcome, the second bull leg 5 was slightly more sloped than the first one 4. This meant an acceleration of the trend. In turn, that could mean a trend reversal after pullback breakout failure; specifically around bar 6.

However that trend reversal assessment was rather weak. There was still a reasonable possible bull trend resumption. I was watching the market very closely waiting for it.

After the failure at bar 6, the market went down and consolidated around the micro trading range 9.

Finally, my today's micro price action setup was formed.

Firstly, the market broke out from the micro trading range 9 with a large outside bull bar 1 with the close being near the high.

However the next bar 2 formed a trading range bar. That was one bar pullback.

The next bar 3 was again strong bull bar like bar 1. The market was started moving fast in align with the major bull trend.

So I opened a bull position. Then I quickly profited near the high of the bull spike. After that, the market turned down significantly.

The bears was strong enough to happen it. It means that I was risking too much. I was obsessed with the bull major trend ealier today too much.
