The EURUSD market was bull today.

Firstly, the whopping 40.0 pips bull spike at bar 1, overwhelming a downward spike just before it, clearly started the major trend.

The last bar of the spike and the reversal bear bar 2 formed a micro double top, initiating the first pull back.

The pull back made three pushes (bar 3, 4, 5) pushing the market down just above the start of the strong bull spike.

The third bear leg of pushes (bar 5) looked like a exhaustion and probably was, alarming traders a trend reversal bar 5. At the micro scope, there was also a micro two-bar reversal.

In the such prior price actions, the bulls started to try stopping the pull back and create a higher low and hopefully the resume of bull trend.

So, I bought 0.1 lot at 1.36731 targeting to 136800.

But the bull failed this time. Before not long, the bulls let the bears break the major large bull trend line formed by bar 1, 5, and 6. The proceeding three bar bear spike (bar 6) turned to frighten the majority of bulls.

After the failure, the bulls got a second chance of the trend reversal with the micro double bottom (bar 6 and 7). However still the bull failed. The market needed more price down.

The bears reigned the market and managed to create two push downs. However the bulls was desperate to keep the absolute support line of the price of bar 0.

The bear era ended at bar 9 of higher low. Finally the bulls gained the control starting at bar 9 and created a tight bull channel strongly moving above bar 10, which was the bear's last hope.
