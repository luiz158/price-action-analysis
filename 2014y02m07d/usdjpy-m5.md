Overall, today's USDJPY created a major triangle 3 and a bull channel breaking from it. And I traded eagerly with bull mind.

The today's later part of the upward breakout was indicated by a rather strong bull channel 4 with three push-ups, first. Then market drifted almost horizontally, with weak declination of the price, second.

The today's major breakout occurred at the strong bull bar 1. And it was followed by another similar strong bull bar 2. So I eagerly opened a position in the middle of the formation of the bar 2.

I was aware this trading is a bit early entry. So, after admitting the trading range 5 is formed, I bumped my position. I was afraid that this wasn't a triangle breakout, rather just top of the major trading range. Only after, there was another strong bull channel I hoped for.

I didn't hesitated to be in the market this time with eager mind. This time too, in the middle of the last bar of the trading range 5, I just sensed an impeding bull breakout. So I did act on accordingly, immediately locking a measured-move profit.

Even after the two bull spikes, the bulls didn't lose its momentum. So the always-in was bull at this point. At least the market would follow the spike-and-channel pattern.

After the third push up, which I missed, I was thinking the possibility of unusually strong price move to the sky, which was common recently in the USDJPY.

So, after seeing a high 1 setup 6 with gap, I entered into the market wishing a fortune.

But that couldn't come true. The market turned down after a two-bar reversal.
