USDJPY had fairly strong bear trend today. It moved almost like a ideal textbook example.

When I became ready for trading around the middle of the second strong bear push down of 3, I was thinking the possibility of yet another push down, resulting in a three push downs. The pullback 2 had ended at a test of the moving average without barely touching it. It had signified the strength of the bears.

So, when the market was forming another tight pullback 4, I was determined to enter the market at any time.

Then a bear breakout occurred at the two bars later the bar 4 below the bear trend line 6, following a three bar consecutive micro bear trend, which supported the bear breakout to some extent.

Although the market momentum looked solid, I was a bit worried for a trend reversal. So, I setup rather a pedantic strategy; a equally-sized-profit-and-loss bear position.

Then my position was filled. Next, there was a two bar breakout reversal test 7, which was a good thing.

However my position wasn't closed at the bar 7. I insisted to hold it open, patiently waiting for further bear move, sticking to the original profit target.

Anyway, shortly after that, I won relatively quickly after the open of the position.

And my concern came true. The market finally started to reverse to the bull after a very long bear major trend throughout today.
