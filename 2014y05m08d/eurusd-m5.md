Today, I tried to profit from extremely strong bull trend caused by a economic news release. But I failed miserably...

Up to bar 1, there was strong bull spike. Including bar 1, the bars kept higher high than previous bars. And the bar 1 seemed one bar pullback.

So, I opened a bull position with my usual full-sized profit/loss target. Considering the size of the spike, that was relatively conservative target. So I was hoping optimistic.

However, the market failed to breakout and turned down hard. The next bar of the setup bar 1 just only went around the preceding spike high, forming a double top.

The high of the spike was close my profit target. However it didn't touch.

After that, the market created extremely rare strong bear trend with whopping 140.0 pip.s move.
