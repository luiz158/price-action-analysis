EURUSD recovered to the level where it was at early today after rampant bear move.

Today's New York session was started with an economic news released at bar 6.

Although bulls first soared after it, they was resisted sharply at the high of bar 5, creating the resistance line 3. As a matter of fact, after the day, it was revisited at bar 7 again.

Quickly the market changed its mood with the price getting lower and lower to the end of the first bear leg 8.

Then, as usual exactly like a textbook example, it formed a pullback 9. The market tend to move ideally when there ware strong move before it.

After leaving a low 1 pullback setup 9, the market gained its downward momentum again. However, after the entry bar of the setup, it revered to the bull. And it was rather strong. This could be an exhaustion of bears.

After it the bear managed to reach the today's low with no success of breaking out. The market went to the moving average. In retrospect, a double bottom was formed with the bar after bar 9.

In the time of weakening bears, the bulls pushed the market further with bull spike bar 10, almost ending the major bear trend. In the end, it lead to a bull spike and channel pattern.

Before bar 1, I was expecting a V-shaped recovery. So, I was looking for such a setup.

Then there was setup bar 1 for a bull breakout; a strong bull bar and bear trend line, of pullback of strong bull bar spike bar 10, breakout test at the low of it.

I opened my position and I placed a stop loss order below the low of bar 1 and with wider take profit order.

The market broke out upwards at bar 2. And after a minor 2-bar pull back, it again spiked higher.

The market was behaving as precisely I expected. That meant it's also possible that the market could reverse lower sharply too.

So I existed with market order with moderate profit.

Afterwards, after touching the resistance line 3 at bar 7, the market went lower.
