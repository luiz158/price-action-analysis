On 11 June, I initiated several scalping orders, resuting in successive profits.

At bar 10, the market transitioned from orderly to aggressive. Abrupting bear channel 9, it soared to the high of bull spike and climax 5.

Then a pull back started; the usual beginnings of the spike and channel pattern. This time, the pull back was well-behaved. It was a clearly visible two-legged pullback. After failed high 1 setup 12 by outside bar 11 at the end of trading range price consolidation 13, it formed a second leg. Second thought, this pullback reversal succeeded to some extent.

Then, following the reversal, the market again started to go up.

After breaking out from the pullback channel 14, it was clear that the major market trend resumed to bulls for every traders.

That's why the market managed to create dacent-shaped bull channel 15.

In larger picture, the market tested the moving average at 16. Also it created a gap 17.

This was the condition when I entered today's US session late.

Confirming a high 2 setup at bar 15. I was looking for a bull entry. The bar after bar 15 was a good bull bar.

So, I opened a bull position.

As discussed this current bull channel was't bad. On the other hand, the previous pullback was good. And, the major market was bull overall. These 3 considerations lead to the conclution of moderate bull trend.

So I was skeptical for a resume of strong bull trend.

My setup was at the high of bull trend channel line for upside breakout. The stop was between the low of entry bar and the high of bar 15 as a micro gap. The take was adjusted for an equal size to the stop order's width.

After confirming an expected bull spike, the market was a bit hustry. So I closed my position near the take order as much as possible by hand.

The concern was right; the market reversed to bear after the test of previous high with immeidate reversal at 4. And it created double top 8 bar 4 with previous high 5. In the end the market formed a final flag.

The market then dropped significantly. There were three push downs 1, 2, and 3. And bear almost-vertical bear trend line 6. In the cource of them, I opened positions for a new bear leg breaking out previous leg's low.

After the three push downs, the market stopped moving.

Finally, the market created triple bottom 7. I called it a day.
