I traded very aggressively today.

Before I started to watch the market, there was strong bear trend. It was very tight and clear move of 40.0 pips.

Then the first pull back was the trading range 1. This time too, the market moved very tightly, horizontally.

The trading range ended around the moving average test.

Then the market went downside very quickly.

Next, another pullback of the trading range 2 was created.

In this situation, it was modest bet to believe in the bears. I was keenly watching the market.

The second pullback went around the moving average almost-ideally horizontally too.

The pattern was repeated. That means its impedant breakout would be like the breakout from the first pullback. And It did as such.

I opened below the low of the trading range 2. Its stop was above the high ot the trading range. Its take-profit was some what arbitaraly. It was slrightly wider than the stop-loss.

At the end, the market went down immediately after I opened a position.

My guest was right, so believing in my faith blindly was hurt.

Intead of continuation of bear spike to my original take-profit order, I feared that the market would create double bottom with 3.

So, I quickly closed my position around measured move of the height of trading range 2.

In fact, after exiting from the market, the market continued to be cheaper for a bit time, barely touching my original take-profit order.
