Today's USDJPY was reigned by an extremely strong bear. It had dropped a whopping 150.0 pips. However, each and every trend ends at some point as we know.

There was a trading range 2, after another aggressive bear trend. Considering the strong bear sentiment of the market, the existence of such uncertainty is rather odd. It alarmed the traders for the end of the bear trend or weakening of it at the very least.

I was seeking a situation like this at time same time the obvious revival of bear trend while I was closely watching the trading range 2. The last part of it slightly was pushed upward (a micro bull leg 5; a bull trend line 4 in larger scope, too).

With all things considered, I concluded that the bull would win, beating the bears armed with the major bear trend line 1 and the moving average reversal.

Immediately after, I opened a bull position expecting an equivalent move of the price to the height of the trading range. I knew the day is bear day, so I wasn't optimistic to expect more from the bulls.

My position is closed exactly around the measured move with profit. I though the bears would appear there, however, to tell the truth, bulls created another strong bull leg.

After a while, there was a tight bear channel line. So, I expected revival of the extreme bear trend finally. Thereby, I opened a bear position this time. However the bears failed to breakout and allowed the bulls to form a major higher high. So I closed my position with small profit, exposing myself to the market for the very short time.

Finally, a triangle was formed by trend line 3 and 8. After second thought, the proceeding two strong bull trend legs signified this which enabled the formation of higher high.
